- Team size: ${teamSize || 'Not specified'}
- Time horizon: ${timeHorizon || 'Not specified'}

TASK:
Create a structured concept card that captures the essence of their idea. Do NOT add features or change the core concept.

Respond in this exact JSON format:
{
  "title": "A catchy 2-4 word title for the game",
  "conceptParagraph": "A single paragraph (2-3 sentences) that clearly explains the game concept, maintaining the user's original vision",
  "coreVerbs": ["verb1", "verb2", "verb3"],

- Avoid generic clones and vague descriptions
- Keep mechanics concrete and testable
- Make each idea distinct in genre and feel
- Prefer ideas that can be built by 1-2 people quickly
- Prioritize ideas that combine multiple Ikigai overlap items
- VARY the game formats across the 10 ideas. Include a mix of:
  * Open World / Sandbox (player-driven exploration)
  * Linear Story / Narrative (guided experience)
  * Roguelike / Run-based (repeatable sessions with progression)
  * Endless / Arcade (score-chasing, no end state)
  * Puzzle / Level-based (discrete challenges)
  * Simulation / Management (systems and optimization)
  * Multiplayer / Party (social interaction focus)
